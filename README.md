# Twenty Thirteen A11y Plus

A simple child theme for Twenty Thirteen with small tweaks to make your favorite theme more accessible.

## What this Theme Does

* Adds an underline to links so they do not rely on color alone.
* Enhances the `:focus` style on links so the visual style is stronger than the standard dotted border.
* Sizes fonts with the `rem` unit (with a `px` fallback for unsupported browsers) so user's custom font sizes are respected.
* Changes the default black text to be slightly darker to work with new burnt orange color so main colors meet WCAG 2.0 AA standard.
* Changes burnt orange color to be slightly darker to work with both back text and white text so main colors meet WCAG 2.0 AA standard.

**On a WordPress.com site**

1. You'll need the [Custom Design Upgrade](http://en.support.wordpress.com/custom-design/custom-css/).
2. Copy just the `CSS` in the style.css file.
3. Paste it in the appropriate place via WordPress.com. See [these handy instructions](http://en.support.wordpress.com/custom-design/editing-css/).
